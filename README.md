>## FRAMES AND DESCRIPTION

*In this section, the whole framework will be described in an elaborated and a sequential way which will help the users to know more about its working and functionality and any person will be able to use it with the utmost usability* -:
 
### Register Page:



<p> Now as the application is launched, the first window which appears in front of the user is the register page, which will ask the user to enter his/her respective details in order to complete the registration process and create a new account which will be used in the future. On completing the registration process, a pop up window appears which confirms that an account has been created successfully. The Register page comprises of various text fields and combo boxes which are:<>
Name: Should not contain any digits or any other special characters (only alphabets).
Gender: Users can choose the gender as per their choice.(combo box). (Mandatory field)
Username: The users can keep the username according to their comfort but have to remember it as it will be asked at the time of logging in. The username has to be distinct for each account in order to avoid any ambiguities(Can contain alphanumeric characters as well as special symbols
Email: Can be upto 40 characters in length comprising of alphanumeric and special symbols (has to be in the format @xyz.com)(also has to be distinct for each account)
Password: Contains alphanumeric characters, one upper case character and a special symbol. Length can be from 8 - 20 characters. ( cannot be the same for any user).
 At the end, there is a Jbutton for confirmation and creating the account and an option to directly go to the login page if an account already exists.
Regular Expression (Regex) was used in the backend code of this frame to ensure that the users enter the data according to the constraints provided above.
